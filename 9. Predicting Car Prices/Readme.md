# Introduction

This is an expansion on the guided project I completed with [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io) under the "Machine Learning Fundamentals" course of Step 6. In addition to the guided KNN univariate and multivariate analysis with train/test validation (and the cleaning of the dataset), the project includes:
* Multivariate KNN analysis with holdout validation
* Multivariate KNN analysis with manual k-fold validation
* A merging of all three multivariate algorithms into one `knn_trainer` class
* Comparison of all four algorithms' RMSE (root mean squared error)
